## Task 1: Activation Functions and FF pre-trained Neural Network <br/> CC6204 Deep Learning, Universidad de Chile.
#### Name: Humberto Rodrigues

This project is a Quickstart to Neural Networks using `Pytorch` the goal is the understanding of the most basic concepts
and the creation of a first model using fixed parameters, however, the code built is general enough to support more
complex models that the are being explored in this work.
